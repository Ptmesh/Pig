# PIG - A Dice Rolling Game

PIG is a fun and strategic dice-rolling game for 2 to 4 players. The game is simple but requires careful decision-making and a bit of luck to win.

## How It Works

- Players take turns to roll a die and try to accumulate points.
- On each roll:
  - If a player rolls a **1**, they lose all points gained during that turn, and their turn ends immediately.
  - If they roll a **2-6**, the number is added to their current turn score.
- Players can decide to **stop rolling** at any time to save their accumulated points for that turn and add them to their total score.
- The first player to reach or exceed **50 points** wins the game.
- If all players choose to stop rolling in a round without reaching 50 points, the game ends, and the player(s) with the highest score win.

## Future Scope

I plan to improve the game with:

- A graphical user interface (GUI) for a more engaging experience.
- An online multiplayer mode to play with friends remotely.
- A scoreboard to track and display the highest scores among players.

## Additional Information

- The game is coded in Python.
- Any suggestions, feedback, or contributions are welcome!
